      <description>In todayâ€™s systems, policies protecting stored data and mechanisms for their enforcement are spread across many software components, increasing the risk of violation due to bugs, vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. We suggest Guardat to addresses this problem. Users, developers and administrators specify file protection policies declaratively, concisely and separate from code, and Guardat enforces these policies by mediating I/O in the storage layer. Thus, policy enforcement relies only on the integrity of the Guardat controller and any external policy dependencies.</description>

      <description>Isolating sensitive data and state can increase the security and robustness of many applications. Applications, such as isolating cryptographic session keys in a network-facing application or isolating frequently invoked native libraries in managed runtimes, require very frequent domain switching. In such applications, the overhead of kernel- or hypervisormediated domain switching is prohibitive. We suggest ERIM, a novel technique, that provides hardware-enforced isolation with low overhead, even at high switching rates (ERIM&amp;rsquo;s average overhead is less than 1% for 100,000 switches per second).</description>
