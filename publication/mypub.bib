  abstract={Today computers store and analyze valuable and sensitive data. As a result we need to protect this data against confidentiality and integrity violations that can result in the illicit release, loss, or modification of a user’s and an organization’s sensitive data such as personal media content or client records. Existing techniques protecting confidentiality and integrity lack either efficiency or are vulnerable to malicious attacks. In this thesis we suggest techniques, Guardat and ERIM, to efficiently and robustly protect persistent and in-memory data. To protect the confidentiality and integrity of persistent data, clients specify per-file policies to Guardat declaratively, concisely and separately from code. Guardat enforces policies by mediating I/O in the storage layer. In contrast to prior techniques, we protect against accidental or malicious circumvention of higher software layers. We present the design and prototype implementation, and demonstrate that Guardat efficiently enforces example policies in a web server. To protect the confidentiality and integrity of in-memory data, ERIM isolates sensitive data using Intel Memory Protection Keys (MPK), a recent x86 extension to partition the address space. However, MPK does not protect against malicious attacks by itself. We prevent malicious attacks by combining MPK with call gates to trusted entry points and ahead-of-time binary inspection. In contrast to existing techniques, ERIM efficiently protects frequently-used session keys of web servers, an in-memory reference monitor’s private state, and managed runtimes from native libraries. These use cases result in high switch rates of the order of 10 5 –10 6 switches/s. Our experiments demonstrate less then 1% runtime overhead per 100,000 switches/s, thus outperforming existing techniques.}

abstract = {We present a storage primitive called a storage lease. Data stored under a lease cannot be written for a pre-determined period. During the lease period, online data is protected from corruption due to security breaches, software errors, or accidental data deletion. Storage leases fill an important gap in the spectrum of data protection options because they combine strong integrity for online data with the ability to eventually reclaim storage. We define the storage lease primitive, show how it can be implemented in storage device firmware, and discuss its applications. A simulation-based evaluation indicates that storage leases have a modest performance cost for most workloads on magnetic disks. Using a small amount of flash memory, this overhead can be reduced to near zero.},

abstract = {Data retrieval systems process data from many sources, each subject to its own data use policy. Ensuring compli-ance with these policies despite bugs, misconfiguration, or operator error in a large, complex, and fast evolving system is a major challenge. Thoth provides an effi-cient, kernel-level compliance layer for data use policies. Declarative policies are attached to the systems' input and output files, key-value tuples, and network connec-tions, and specify the data's integrity and confidential-ity requirements. Thoth tracks the flow of data through the system, and enforces policy regardless of bugs, mis-configurations, compromises in application code, or ac-tions by unprivileged operators. Thoth requires minimal changes to an existing system and has modest overhead, as we show using a prototype Thoth-enabled data re-trieval system based on the popular Apache Lucene.},

@inproceedings{Litton2016,
abstract = {We introduce a new OS abstraction—light-weight con- texts (lwCs)—that provides independent units of protec- tion, privilege, and execution state within a process. A process may include several lwCs, each with possibly different views of memory, file descriptors, and access capabilities. lwCs can be used to efficiently implement roll-back (process can return to a prior recorded state), isolated address spaces (lwCs within the process may have different views of memory, e.g., isolating sensitive data from network-facing components or isolating differ- ent user sessions), and privilege separation (in-process reference monitors can arbitrate and control access). lwCs can be implemented efficiently: the overhead of a lwC is proportional to the amount of memory exclu- sive to the lwC; switching lwCs is quicker than switching kernel threads within the same process. We describe the lwC abstraction and API, and an implementation of lwCs within the FreeBSD 11.0 kernel. Finally, we present an evaluation of common usage patterns, including fast roll- back, session isolation, sensitive data isolation, and in- process reference monitoring, using Apache, nginx, PHP, and OpenSSL.},
