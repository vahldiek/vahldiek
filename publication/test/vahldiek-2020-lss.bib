  abstract={Computing on secret data is challenging with today’s cloud service provider (CSP)
  offerings. CSP have full visibility into their client’s workloads and data while run in a VM or
  container and shielding against other tenants. On the contrary, confidential computing (CC)
  techniques (e.g., Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX)) offer a reverse sandbox. These techniques
  shield the workload and data from accesses by the underlying system software (e.g., OS or VMM) and
  hardware attacks. Thus, preventing CSPs from accessing secrets. In addition, CC provides remote
  attestation to verify the integrity of applications. In this talk we will present Graphene Secure
  Containers, a technique to automatically wrap an unmodified Linux application packaged in a
  container image to execute inside Intel SGX using the Graphene LibraryOS and allow users to verify
  application integrity via remote attestation.}
