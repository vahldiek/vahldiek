  publisher={Guest Lecture for Operating System class at IIT Kharagpur},
  abstract={In this lecture we review existing operating system abstractions and review their
  effectiveness in a changing world where workloads are deployed in the cloud, run in high-level
  languages, and rely on fast communication. We take a deep dive into single address-space OS
  and discuss their advantages, disadvantages and challenges in implementing them.}
