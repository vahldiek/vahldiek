      <description>Isolating sensitive data and state can increase the security and robustness of many applications. Applications, such as isolating cryptographic session keys in a network-facing application or isolating frequently invoked native libraries in managed runtimes, require very frequent domain switching. In such applications, the overhead of kernel- or hypervisormediated domain switching is prohibitive. We suggest ERIM, a novel technique, that provides hardware-enforced isolation with low overhead, even at high switching rates (ERIM&amp;rsquo;s average overhead is less than 1% for 100,000 switches per second).</description>
